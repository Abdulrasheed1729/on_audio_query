  ///
  /// Having the default value of [gaplessPlayback] be false helps prevent
  /// situations where stale or misleading information might be presented.
  /// Consider the following case:
  ///
  /// We have constructed a 'Person' widget that displays an avatar [Image] of
  /// the currently loaded person along with their name. We could request for a
  /// new person to be loaded into the widget at any time. Suppose we have a
  /// person currently loaded and the widget loads a new person. What happens
  /// if the [Image] fails to load?
  ///
  /// * Option A ([gaplessPlayback] = false): The new person's name is coupled
  /// with a blank image.
  ///
  /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
  /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.
  ///
  /// Important:
  ///
  /// * If [keepOldArtwork] is null, will be set to [false].
  final bool? keepOldArtwork;
